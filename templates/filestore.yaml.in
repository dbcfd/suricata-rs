  # Output module for storing files on disk. Files are stored in
  # directory names consisting of the first 2 characters of the
  # SHA256 of the file. Each file is given its SHA256 as a filename.
  #
  # When a duplicate file is found, the timestamps on the existing file
  # are updated.
  #
  # Unlike the older filestore, metadata is not written by default
  # as each file should already have a "fileinfo" record in the
  # eve-log. If write-fileinfo is set to yes, then each file will have
  # one more associated .json files that consist of the fileinfo
  # record. A fileinfo file will be written for each occurrence of the
  # file seen using a filename suffix to ensure uniqueness.
  #
  # To prune the filestore directory see the "suricatactl filestore
  # prune" command which can delete files over a certain age.
